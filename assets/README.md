# Assets

## Storage Rules
- **Git (small text only):** manifests, metadata, tiny placeholders.
- **Git LFS:** 3D models, textures, HDRs, and other binaries.
- **External storage:** large production packs or scans.

## Recommended Structure
- `assets/manifests/`
- `assets/models/`
- `assets/textures/`
- `assets/metadata/`

## Naming
- Use lowercase and hyphens.
- Include version suffixes (e.g., `library-v01.glb`).

## Size Rules
- No binaries in standard git history.
- Keep demo assets minimal and lightweight.
